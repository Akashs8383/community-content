## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to install **aPanel**, a powerful server management control panel, on a Hetzner VPS. aPanel simplifies the process of managing websites, databases, and security configurations on your server. The steps outlined here use the provided installation script to streamline the setup process.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- A **Hetzner VPS** with **root access**.
- **Ubuntu 20.04** or **CentOS 7** installed on your server.
- Basic understanding of SSH and server management.

## Step 1 - Log in to Your Hetzner VPS

First, connect to your Hetzner VPS via SSH using the following command:

```bash
ssh root@<your_server_ip>
```

Replace `<your_server_ip>` with the IP address of your VPS. You should use the root user for this process, as it requires administrative privileges.

## Step 2 - Update Your System

Before installing aPanel, it's recommended to update your system packages. Run the following command to ensure everything is up to date:

For **Ubuntu**:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

For **CentOS**:

```bash
yum update -y
```

This will update your system's package manager and upgrade any outdated software.

## Step 3 - Install aPanel

Now that your system is up to date, you can install aPanel using the official installation script. Run the following command to download and execute the script:

```bash
URL=https://www.aapanel.com/script/install_7.0_en.sh && if [ -f /usr/bin/curl ];then curl -ksSO "$URL" ;else wget --no-check-certificate -O install_7.0_en.sh "$URL";fi;bash install_7.0_en.sh
```

This command will:

- Check if `curl` is installed on your server.
- If not, it will use `wget` to download the aPanel installation script.
- Then, the script will install aPanel on your VPS.

## Step 4 - Access aPanel

Once the installation is complete, aPanel will provide you with a URL, username, and password to access the web interface. It will look something like this:

```
http://<your_server_ip>:8888
```

Replace `<your_server_ip>` with your actual server IP, and visit the URL in your web browser. You will be prompted to log in with the credentials provided during installation.

## Step 5 - Secure Your aPanel Installation

To secure your aPanel installation, itâ€™s recommended to:

1. **Change the default password** immediately after logging in.
2. **Enable HTTPS** by configuring an SSL certificate. You can do this directly from the aPanel interface.
3. **Set up a firewall** to restrict access to critical ports and services.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed aPanel on your Hetzner VPS. aPanel makes it easy to manage your server's websites, databases, and other services from a user-friendly interface. Be sure to explore its features and secure your installation further.
